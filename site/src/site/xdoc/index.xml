    <p>
      Portlets are designed to run in the context of a portal. They are
      written to the Portlet API which are similar to the Servlet API.
    </p>
    <p>
        In contrast to servlets, portlets may not do things like sending
        redirects or errors to browsers directly, forwarding requests or writing
        arbitrary markup to the output stream to assure that they don't distract
        the portal web application which uses them. Another difference compared
        to servlets is that portlets rely on portal specific infrastructure
        functions such as access to user profile information, standard interface
        for storing/retrieving persistent settings, getting client information,
        etc. Generally, portlets are administrated more dynamically than
        servlets.
